# Exporting PyTorch Models to ONNX and Running Inference

### Overview

This repository provides a complete guide for exporting PyTorch models to the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format and running inference using ONNX Runtime. The ONNX format allows for machine learning models to be shared across different frameworks and languages, making it an ideal choice for production environments where flexibility, speed, and framework-independence are critical.

## Introduction

ONNX is an open standard format built to represent machine learning models. It enables interoperability between different deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Caffe, and facilitates deployment on a wide variety of platforms including mobile and edge devices. 

This repository demonstrates how to:
1. Export a pre-trained PyTorch model to the ONNX format.
2. Use ONNX Runtime to run inference on the exported model.

For more detailed information about the ONNX format, check the official [ONNX documentation](https://onnx.ai/).

## Advantages of Using ONNX

- **Framework Interoperability**: ONNX models can be transferred between different machine learning frameworks.
- **Optimized Inference**: ONNX Runtime is optimized for performance, providing faster inference than the native implementations.
- **Flexible Deployment**: ONNX models can be executed in various programming environments such as C++, Python, Java, and more, without requiring dependencies on the original training framework.

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision onnx onnxruntime numpy onnxruntime-tools 
```
